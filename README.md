# Football-Prediction
It is my first solo study in machine learning and Python, prepared in 2020, whether there is a correlation between football betting data and matches.

I used classification algorithms with the data set obtained by collecting the bet bulletins daily. 
The objective was to determine if a correlation between bet values and scoreline exists. 
Initially, I gathered data in Excel and then stored it in MongoDB because I used the local web as an interface later. (The web code is not here.)

There were no significant results with using bet bulletins on hand. Thence obtaining and using data such as teams' score, offence, and defence would have yielded more accurate results.
Bulletins are data that change according to sports competitions and player demands.
